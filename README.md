# Firebase Transaction Error: Improperly Formatted Update Values

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase when handling transactions. The error occurs when the transaction callback attempts to update the document with a value that does not conform to Firebase's data type expectations. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, such as an infinite loop or incorrect data updates.

## Problem
The provided `bug.js` file contains a flawed transaction that fails to handle the case where the current data is not properly formatted (e.g., `currentData.value` is not a number when adding 1). This leads to incorrect updates or unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach.  Before performing any operation on `currentData`, validate its format and handle potential exceptions, ensuring the update value always conforms to the expected Firebase data type.  This prevents errors and ensures data integrity.
